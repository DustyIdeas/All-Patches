# **Patch Notes** -  2/12/24 @ 7:18 PM PT

## **Updates**
- **Updated for Minecraft Bedrock version `1.21.60`.**  
  *Note:* This version is not compatible with earlier releases.

---

## **Added**  
### **Teleportation Toggle System**  
- **New GUI Option**: You can enable or disable player teleportation when outside the border through the settings menu.

- **Improved GUI Information**  
  The main menu now shows more details, like whether border damage is enabled and what the Nether/End radius ratio is set to (e.g., `1:1` if disabled, `1:8` if enabled).  

- **Custom Tag Command**: Use `/tag @r add _br_toggleteleporting` to toggle this feature for all players                                         
  - **Note:** This tag has a global effect – applying it to *any* player (even using `@r` for random selection) toggles the border for *all players*. The `@r` selector ensures the command runs without targeting specific players. This applies to all tag-based command systems.
  
  - By default, teleportation is **disabled**. Running the command will toggle it on or off.

## **Fixes**
- **Resolved Crash When Changing Border Radius**  
  Adjusting the border-radius no longer causes crashes due to excessive particle spawning.  
  - *Issue Details:* Crashes occurred because particles were generated too frequently during radius updates.
