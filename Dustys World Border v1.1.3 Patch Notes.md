# Patch Notes

# **Added:**
  - **Implemented a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming of messages when players cross the border.**
  
  - **Added a 5-second cooldown to ensure that each player only receives a message once every 5 seconds.**

  - **Integrated a timestamp check to handle the cooldown effectively, so players receive messages only after the cooldown period elapses.**

# **Improved:**
  - **Adjusted the message display code to show messages based on player-specific conditions.**

 - **Ensured messages are shown only when players are detected crossing the border and are outside the border zone.**

# Note for Users

- If you have any questions or require further information about the addon, feel free to open an issue. While I may not disclose specific encryption or obfuscation methods, I am available to address concerns and provide assistance.

- These patches have been tested, but please provide feedback on any bugs or glitches you encounter.

- Your insights and feedback are valuable in improving this addon. Please report any issues or suggest enhancements to help us continually refine the experience. [**Open New Issue**](https://github.com/DustyIdeas/All-Patches/issues/new/choose)

- You can find the original download on MCPEDL. For this add-on, visit: 
```https://mcpedl.com/dusty-s-world-border-with-customizable-gui/```

- If you encounter issues with the script not working or the GUI not opening, ensure that you have the required experimental features enabled: Beta API's, Upcoming Creator Features, and Holiday Creator Features. While enabling only the Beta API's might work, enabling all three will future-proof the setup.

- Make sure you are on Minecraft version 1.21 or later (the current latest version is 1.21.2).

- Ensure cheats are enabled in your world.

- Use the `/function Panel` command to be given the item, instead of obtaining it through the creative menu (though it seemed to work through the creative menu as well).
